Epitech Tech 1 Project

One of the biggest project in Epitech

This project is cut of 3 parts mysh1, mysh2 and 42sh.

For this project we had to recreate a UNIX command interpreter in which he can compile commands like a real terminal

The program displays a prompt "$>" and wait for a command.

If he didn't found the command, an error message is displayed.

You can run : ls, pwd, cd, setenv, unsetenv, exit and env.

# Usage
